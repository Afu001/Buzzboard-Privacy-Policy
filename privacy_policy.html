  <h1>Privacy Policy for BuzzBoard</h1>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how BuzzBoard ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application ("App").</p>
  
  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do not collect any personal information directly from users. The App functions as a dashboard for accessing student data from the SZABIST university portal. When users log in to the App, their university credentials are sent securely to our server. We do not store these credentials. Our server sends the credentials to a scraper API, which retrieves data such as assignment marks, quiz marks, and CGPA from the SZABIST university portal. This data is then sent back to the user's device and displayed within the App.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Collect Data</h2>
  <p>Data is collected through user input when logging in to the App. The user voluntarily provides their university credentials to access their data from the SZABIST university portal.</p>

  <h2>3. Purpose of Data Collection</h2>
  <p>The data is collected to provide users with a convenient and organized view of their academic information from the SZABIST university portal.</p>

    <h2>4. Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>We do not store user login information (username or password) on our servers. However, the user's username and password are securely stored in the local storage of the user's device within the App. The data retrieved from the SZABIST university portal, such as marks and attendance, is also stored locally on the user's device within the App. This data is not sensitive and is securely stored within the App.</p>

  <h2>5. Sharing of User Data</h2>
  <p>We do not share any user data with third parties.</p>

  <h2>6. User Rights</h2>
  <p>Users do not have the ability to access, delete, or correct the data retrieved from the SZABIST university portal through the App. The App simply displays the information provided by the university portal.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>For privacy-related concerns or inquiries, users may contact us via email at <a href="mailto:khawajaaswadulhusnain">khawajaaswadulhusnain</a>.</p>
